            "summary": "So i broke down today and i bought a new computer. Well it is going to replace my current first generation Mac Mini G4 1.42 Ghz. Basically i found myself pretty much waiting 60% of the time instead of programming. Just having Eclipse, Photoshop, Apache, Firefox and iTunes open grinds this little machine to a halt. My solution yesterday was to just remote into my work machine and do all my work on that, it worked well but it is not a permanent solution. With my mom getting a new 20” iMac and the new Intel chips smoking the pants off the PowerPC chips i needed to upgrade. Also this will allow me to get rid of my Windows box for good, i will be running Parallels for any future Windows needs. The setup i ordered is not like super awesome impressive but it will do for now.",

It handles all that same great XHTML formatting, you just have to worry about where you want to flied to be displayed.",

So Simpl now will not connect to the database until the first query comes by that could not be found in cache. We have found that this also improves performance especially if the database is on a separate machine. There is only one downside to this addition, when calling $db->Connect() it will always return true since it just stores the database information and waits for the first query, you will no longer be able to check on connect if the database is available or not, it will always look available.",
