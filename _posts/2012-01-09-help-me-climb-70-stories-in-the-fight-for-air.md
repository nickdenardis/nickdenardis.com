[![](/images/logo-climb-2012.png "2012 Fight for Air Climb")](http://j.mp/w20yLn )On March 4th, 2012 I am going to take on Michigan's tallest building ([the Renaissance Center](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=the%20Renaissance%20Center)) all the way to the 70th floor by climbing 1,035 stairs. I am climbing in the [American Lung Association's Fight for Air Climb](http://www.lungusa.org/pledge-events/mi/detroit-climb-fy12/) to help raise money for lung disease research, education and advocacy.

I am doing so because I am able. I can breathe freely and there are many people who are not as lucky. I am joining a team of likeminded Web designers and developers from Detroit on my journey, our team name is the "[Quadzillas](http://action.lungusa.org/site/TR/Climb/ALAML_Midland_States?pg=team&fr_id=3641&team_id=36173)".

### I am writing this blog post because I would love your support

[![](/images/thermometer-50.gif "Half way there!")](http://action.lungusa.org/site/TR/Climb/ALAML_Midland_States?pg=team&fr_id=3641&team_id=36173)For the 2012 Fight for Air stair climb my team would like to raise a minimum of $1,035 dollars, or $1 for every step in the GM Renaissance Center.

We need your help! You can donate to one person, or spread it out among the members. [You can donate](http://j.mp/w20yLn) $1 (one step) or $15 (one floor) or any amount you want! Either way you choose to donate is greatly appreciated! Or if you would like to join me I would be honored to climb with you!

Your donation to the American Lung Association will sustain their commitment to the prevention of all respiratory diseases including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and asthma.

Thank you for your support of my effort to raising money for this very important cause.
