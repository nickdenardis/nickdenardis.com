Since everyone is anxiously awaiting their migration to the [#newtwitter](http://twitter.com/newtwitter), including myself, I thought I would share what the interface looks like. Logging in this morning I discovered my university account [@waynestate](http://twitter.com/waynestate) was migrated so I took the oportunity to share some screen shots. I haven't had time to play with it too much so a full review will be coming shortly.

In the mean time enjoy these shots:
