When does a senior project go too far?

- When you are doing a project that is in [your profession](http://wcs.wayne.edu/)?
- When you [register a domain name](http://motorcitysoftware.net) for your “company”?
- When you [create a logo](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/1440826398/) for your “company”?
- When you consider creating t-shirts for your “company”?
- Or is it when you apply for a doing business as name?

Just pick one. We unfortunately just have one left…
