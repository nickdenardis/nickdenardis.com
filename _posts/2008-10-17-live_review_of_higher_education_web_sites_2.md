Working through technical issues, I changed my screen resolution to better match the HD requirements of some sites and I tried to buy a new mic at Target (We had gift certificates) but it totally sucked and didn’t work with my computer.

Anyways next episode and three new sites reviewed. Check them out and let me know what you think. Do you like the format? Is three sites too many? Not enough? I spend about 5 minutes on each site but it feels almost like I am rushing through a checklist of requirements for me to give it the thumbs up. I don’t want the show to become a checklist. Next episode I am going to try something new depending on your comments. So comment below or [Twitter me](http://twitter.com/nickdenardis/).

I did not want to reveal the title for the new site till next episode but since it was taking waaay too long to re-encode the video without the title on it I thought what the heck why not let everyone know the name of the site. Enjoy.
