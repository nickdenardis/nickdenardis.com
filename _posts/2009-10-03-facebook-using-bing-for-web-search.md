### Has anyone noticed that in the Facebook main search the Web Results are provided by "Bing"?

It seems like more sites are switching to Bing as their search engine. Is this the result of sites that already used live.com search? Or is Bing really pushing an incentive to switch to their engine?

Is this new or am I just slow?
