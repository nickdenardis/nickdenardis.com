Cleaning up after a release.  
Thanks to everyone who has been using and testing [PHPSimpl](http://code.google.com/p/phpsimpl/). After our first official release we wanted to squash some bugs, here is a list of the updates in 0.8.1:  

- Slightly Updated Example
- Fixed the form label ”?:” issue
- Better support for tables without a primary key
- Fixed the SimpleFormat to display values properly and renamed it to Nice()
- Change DB now counted as a query
- View() now goes off the default field display first
- Security Updates related to SQL injection

Its a Recommended Update
