title: "PHPSimpl API Documentation"

So we started to document the PHPSimpl API, which is quite a large task since we did not start the documentation process till the API was almost complete. Although PHPSimpl has almost full JavaDoc documentation throughout the source it is a pain to open up the source every time you need to look up the parameters to a function call. So we started to document all the classes, functions, examples of their use and return values at the projects homepage wiki. Most of the classes are in there now and more will be added shortly. If you would like to contribute to the documentation effort just let me know and I can add you to the list.
