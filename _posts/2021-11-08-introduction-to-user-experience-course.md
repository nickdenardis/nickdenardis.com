## Overall thoughts

I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to share these principles that I use on a daily basis with the world and in a format that walks through each in detail with examples. Each video is captioned and offers various playback speeds. 

The Pearson and O‚ÄôReilly team made this possible, the process was rigorous, their quality bar is very high and I cannot thank them enough for the support and guidance throughout the process.

## Orielly free trial

Each of the sections above have a 1-minute preview and [O‚ÄôReilly is currently offering a 10-day free trial](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/try-now.html) to access everything in their entire learning library. If you‚Äôre on the fence about the course or the platform, this is a perfect time dive in and try it out.

## Feedback

If there is something you would like to see covered more/less or if you have any feedback on the contents of the course or how anything is presented or covered, reach out to me on [Twitter @nickdenardis](https://twitter.com/nickdenardis) as I‚Äôm always looking to improve and evolve the material over time.
