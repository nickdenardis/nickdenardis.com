[Web Design World](http://webdesignworld.com/) is coming soon (very soon) – October 18-20 in Las Vegas – and if you've never been before (or even if you have and want to attend this year), they have a great deal to pass along to you! I know it's late in the game for [#highered](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23highered) but I thought I would pass this along just in case.

First of all, Web Design World has a great line-up of rock stars in design, UX, content management and more. There will even be a session entitled "Education vs. Other Markets: How Does Design Differ?" with Patrick Haney and Dan Rubin. You can check out the full conference agenda at [http://bit.ly/WDWAgenda](http://bit.ly/WDWAgenda).

The organizers of Web Design World are extending a special discount for the 3-day Web Design World Passport package - just for higher education web designers and webmasters! To save $400 off the Passport package rate, simply register at [http://bit.ly/WDWReg](http://bit.ly/WDWReg) and enter the promo code EDU10.\* That's it!

_\* Please note: $400 discount is applicable to new registrations only. No refunds will be given on prior registrations._

I just wanted to clarify that I am not attending Web Design World nor is this a paid endorsement. Just a friendly post about a discount that pertains to my favorite group, higher education web rock stars! :-)
