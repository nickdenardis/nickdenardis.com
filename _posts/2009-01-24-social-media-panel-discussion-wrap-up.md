[Refresh Detroit](http://refresh-detroit.org/) held a [Social Media Panel Discussion on January 21, 2009](http://refresh-detroit.org/2009/01/14/social-media-panel-discussion-january-21-2009/) that I was lucky enough to be part of. It was the first time I had been part of a panel discussion and it was a great experience.

The questions brought out not only the direction and how to for beginners but also the best practices and case studies of the advanced users in the social media field.
