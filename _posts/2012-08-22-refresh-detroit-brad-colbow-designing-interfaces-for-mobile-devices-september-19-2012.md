In design, the user experience is paramount and getting the little details right can make a huge difference. In this presentation Brad talks about his experience designing interfaces for mobile devices and looking at how little changes can have a big impact on how we use them. You will be introduced to the world of human interface guidelines for mobile devices.

- What can we learn by comparing and contrasting the guidelines of these mobile players and how can we incorporate it into our apps and websites?
- What are the main differences in developing for these platforms and what do user experience designers need to take into account before starting a project?
- Should you focus on building an app or make your website mobile friendly instead?
