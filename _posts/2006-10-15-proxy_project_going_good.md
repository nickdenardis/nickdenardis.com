So I finally got my new Mini and my new [Desk](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/270147245/) all setup. Thats all i wanted to say. Oh yea and we are finally seriously working on a new look for the [Wayne State University](http://wayne.edu/) homepage, it desperately needs it (from a back end and management standpoint, the frontend pretty much just needs a [realign](http://alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign)), four years old and designed by a company that went out of business. Now that we have the [tools](http://wcs.wayne.edu/) in place we can get it setup right.
