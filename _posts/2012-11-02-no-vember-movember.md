[@Cliffyballgame](https://twitter.com/cliffyballgame) randomly asked me to join his [Movember team](http://us.movember.com/team/460525). I had thought about doing Movember for the past few years but always had something going on that required me not to look like a total hipster or lumberjack. But this year is different, this November I don't have a single speaking engagement, no travel and no formal anything other than Thanksgiving with the family.

I only shave once a week anyways, it won't be hard to skip four times. So I thought why stop at not shaving?

## Here are a few things that I won't be doing in November:

- Shaving (of course). Going full on lumberjack style.
- Buying lunch (who eats multiple meals a day anyway?)
- Drinking pop (easy)
- Buying basically anything (unless something breaks..)
- Go a day without publishing something online

Ok. The list is a little shorter than I felt in my head but every one of those is going to take some restraint and dedication.

Anyways.. Let's do this November!
