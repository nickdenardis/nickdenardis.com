If you haven't applied or looked already you may be missing out on the New Google Analytics. It looks like they are starting to roll it out slowly and our main university account just got activated. I have only been able to play with it a little and I wanted to share some screen shots to show off some new things.

It seems that the core tools have not changed a lot but the interface around them is completely changed. It feels far more responsive and moving in between pages doesn't have the long loading that plagues the current interface.

The most notable feature addition is the customizable Dashboard which actually does allow you to pull in completely customized "Widgets" into a number of groupings. Creating these widgets is done the same way as segments so there is a lot of functionality.

If there is something specific you want to see just let me know and I can add to these screenshots.
