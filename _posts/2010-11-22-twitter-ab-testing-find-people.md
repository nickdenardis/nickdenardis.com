title: "Twitter A/B Testing \"Find People\""

I oversee a few different Twitter accounts, [@nickdenardis](http://twitter.com/nickdenardis), [@educheckup](http://twitter.com/educheckup), and [@waynestate](http://twitter.com/waynestate) just to name a few and usually have them all open throughout the day. I noticed something interesting today, they are running an A/B test on the wording of a link in the top bar.

The feature, although recently reactivated on the [#newtwitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23newtwitter) design, has yet to get an announcement on the [Twitter Blog](http://blog.twitter.com/). The old "who to follow" feature got it's [fair share of criticism](http://powazek.com/posts/2616) and was removed for a while. My personal opinion is that it was horribly implemented and didn't really help anybody. The new "who to follow" is actually pretty good and I've used it a few times to discover people.

## "Find People" vs. "Who To Follow"

Going in between two accounts today I noticed a difference in wording on the top bar. I ended up trying all my accounts and could only find two different wordings, their might be more though. It looks like Twitter is doing an A/B test with the link title, "Find People" vs. "Who To Follow". I have included some screen shots below.

Personally I prefer "Find People" since it is implies an action and I am being proactive about it. But I can see for Twitter newbies that "who to follow" is more about discovering and that is what would be a more enticing action.

I hope Twitter decides to share some statistics about the test on their official announcement of the feature.

I was just alerted by Jesse Lavery via Twitter that he has a variation that just says "People"

### Update (Nov 29, 2010 at 11:40pm)

And apparently some accounts, like [Mallory Wood](http://twitter.com/mallorywood)'s don't have any link at all to "Find People"

Do you have a different variation? Feel free to post it in the comments.
