So i broke down today and i bought a new computer. Well it is going to replace my current first generation [Mac Mini](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/257325906/) G4 1.42 Ghz. Basically i found myself pretty much waiting 60% of the time instead of programming. Just having Eclipse, Photoshop, Apache, Firefox and iTunes open grinds this little machine to a halt. My solution yesterday was to just remote into my [work machine](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/150722095/) and do all my work on that, it worked well but it is not a permanent solution. With my mom getting a new [20” iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/) and the new Intel chips smoking the pants off the PowerPC chips i needed to upgrade. Also this will allow me to get rid of my Windows box for good, i will be running [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) for any future Windows needs. The setup i ordered is not like super awesome impressive but it will do for now.  

> Mac Mini  
> 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo  
> 2GB 667 DDR2 SDRAM\-2×1GB  
> 120GB Serial ATA drive  
> SuperDrive 8x

  
A MacPro and a Mac Book Pro is on my wish list but not essential at this point. Once my [current project](http://autocityimports.com/) which is a total back/front end re-development of their current architecture gets up and running ill need a more robust environment.If anyone is interested i am selling my windows box, currently i am not selling the monitors (two 19” BenQ flat panels) but i will consider it if someone is interested, here is the setup:  

> AMD Athlon 3200+  
> 512 Mb PC-3200  
> 160 Gig, 2 SATA 150 drives in RAID\-0  
> Nvidia Geforce FX 5700 Ultra  
> DVD\-Rom  
> DVD\-Burner DL 8x
