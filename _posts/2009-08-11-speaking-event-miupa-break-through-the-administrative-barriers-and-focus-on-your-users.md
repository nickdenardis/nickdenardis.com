## Tuesday August 18, 2009, 6-8:30PM

### (Food and networking at 6, Program at 7)

**Southfield Public Library in Southfield, MI**

Nick DeNardis, associate director of web communications at Wayne State University will discuss his approach for reviewing and creating usable web sites.

- A lot of people are involved with planning and constructing a single web site. How can you break through the administrative barrier and focus on your users?
- Become an authority as a web professional and fend off requests that don’t meet your users goals.
- Create a plan for testing and modifying the web site based on your users needs and how they actually use your site.
- I will focus on higher education where a lot of sites offer the same “product”. Identify strategies to stand out and care about your users.
- View your site from an outsiders perspective, does it pass the “ten second test”? Can you find the information you need?
- And last but not least, did you take enough time to care about users with special needs?
