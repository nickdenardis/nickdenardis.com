title: "Becoming a .eduGuru Blogger"

The past two weeks have been interesting. If you have not heard already the site [.eduGuru](http://doteduguru.com/), a higher education web marketing blog was looking for a few new staff bloggers. They held a contest for prospects to submit a guest blog post and the community would vote.

I submitted the article [Tracking Flash Interaction with Google Analytics](http://doteduguru.com/id1313-google-analytics-tracking-flash.html) and after the week of voting I was one of the three chosen to becoming .eduGuru staff. Entering the contest I didn't expect to win, just being part of the awesome higher ed web community was worth it in itself.

Now that I am in the pressure is on. Working with the bigger names and great thinkers I have to step up my game. I have a few post ideas already in the queue and broke the ice with my first staff post that expanded on my guest post. I explained [Tracking outgoing clicks with Google Analytics](http://doteduguru.com/id1496-tracking-outgoing-clicks-with-google-analytics.html), giving an insight to where your visitors are going when they leave your site.

So far everything has been great and the bloggers are super supportive. This is the first blogging "job" I have had, so it is a little different. I am use to working on my own schedule and ideas, but this structure will give me great foundation for consistent posts that will benefit the high ed community.

I want to thank everyone who follows me and has given me feedback, I truly appreciate all of you.
