title: "[What I'm Reading] The back to work edition"
date: "2014-02-04"

I started back to work today after basically a month off if you count holiday break and paternity leave after my wife and I welcomed [Angelo](http://angelodenardis.com/) into our lives. The time gave me some space to relax, re-evaluate and catch up on things, a great refresher. It also gave me the opportunity to read, below are some articles that I found particularly interesting.
