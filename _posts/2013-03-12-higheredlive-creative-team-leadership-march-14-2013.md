On Thursday, March 14, 2013 at 7pm EST I'll be hosting [HigherEdLive](http://higheredlive.com/). I'll be joined by some amazing guests to talk about Creative Team Leadership. It's one thing to bring creative ideas to life as an individual, it's another to lead a team of creatives to produce the highest quality work and always push the envelope. I've asked some of the best creative leaders to join me to talk about what makes a team successful and what skills/environment is necessary to sustain it long term.

My guests, in no particular order, are [Ben Callahan](https://twitter.com/bencallahan), [Bob Crisler](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-j-crisler/13/4a5/977), and [Nick Johnson](https://twitter.com/GtownNick). They are not only accomplished in their own right, but also lead successful creative teams inside and outside higher education.

[Mark your calendars](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NWt0ZTR2czlwY2o2MWVzZTk3MW83cmNtN3Mgbmljay5kZW5hcmRpc0Bt&tmsrc=nick.denardis%40gmail.com), it will be an information packed show with plenty to take away as a director or member of a creative team.
