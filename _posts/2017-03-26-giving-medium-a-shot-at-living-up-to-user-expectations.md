_Why Medium makes it to my daily reading list_

Last year I purged as many incoming [requests for my attention](http://mnmlist.com/how-to-be-less-busy-in-a-busy-busy-world/) as possible. Medium has become something I’ve adopted, enjoy and think it’s worth giving it a shot to stick around.

Video games or watching too many movies wasn’t the problem, to be honest I’ve never done much of either. It was the little things that stole my attention without even realizing it. The small things that I did habitually on a daily, hours or immediate basis that forced me to become deliberate about my time.

## Things I’ve purged checking daily

- Instagram, Twitter, Facebook timelines
- HTML email newsletters
- Push notification for basically anything on my phone

## Things that have stood the test of time

- Email marked as Primary
- [Nuzzle](http://nuzzel.com/) email digest
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) email digest
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) digest
- Podcasts while driving/running

## Medium is for stories, how to’s and personality

Personal stories, interviews and experiences define how opinions are shaped and Medium sets the perfect environment for these stories.

I’ve tried [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), and various other tools to strip away the cruft from sites to create the ideal reading environment. Medium accomplishes this without requiring me to leave the site.

Content curation on the Medium homepage and email have been spot on and they promise to make it better. For me it’s the combination of recommendations by friends, popular items from topics I follow and a few off the wall stories that I wouldn’t have searched out myself. This mix has made it feel far less like typical sites that focus on a descending list of popular articles, but more like a personalized newsletter.

## Writing/cross promoting content on Medium

[Many OG blogger](https://medium.com/m-field-guide/why-should-i-republish-my-blog-content-onto-medium-97523e9a10e#.5vdosdwgr), including myself, believe my content isn’t safe long term on Medium. They are profiting from me and if they shut down tomorrow all my content and following go \*_poof_\* without a way to redirect.

I still maintain my own domain, blog, and email list for content ownership but like others, attention and discovery are slim. The few articles I have posted to Medium include the standard “Originally posted at…” final line to let people know I am more than Medium articles.

This fear is something that Medium should embrace, it means people are putting hard work into the content they produce here. They don’t consider it throw away content and are conscious about their investment.

## Hope for the future

I have hope that Medium will do the right thing and embrace content creators and consumers genuinely to squash these fears. I’m giving Medium a chance to succeed and you should too. It will be pretty clear in a few months with how many people vote with their feet (dollars).
