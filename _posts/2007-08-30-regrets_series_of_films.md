Shiny ideas always catch the eye. I really got inspired by the “Regrets” series of films by [Steve Delahoyde](http://www.coudal.com/regrets.php), the hobbies one really caught my attention, I ended up watching the rest and kept wanting more. The way it was filmed and the mood really sucked me in. The seriousness of the actors really portray a trueness to the subjects. It really inspired me seeing what others have done with their passion to create something so entertaining and yet so true. My regret is not pouring more of my heart and soul into my work.

  
[Check them out](http://www.coudal.com/regrets.php) for yourself, you will enjoy them.
