Every year we go "[up north](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/tags/upnorth/)" (its a Michigan thing) for new years with a few friends and last year we decided to write down our new years resolutions and toss them in the bond fire. One of mine was to write more, I wanted to write a book. Well I did write more but I did not get to finish a book, ended up with five different directions and half starting all of them.

This year I wanted to have a clear direction for my writing and some goals that are actually obtainable. Now that I blog [here](http://nickdenardis.com), the [Web Communcations Blog](http://wcs.wayne.edu/blog/), [.eduGuru](http://doteduguru.com/) and host the [EDU Checkup](http://educheckup.com) video blog I would say from starting from nothing in the past year I have wrote a great deal.

This next year is all about consistency, I am hoping to write on at least this schedule.

- One post every Two weeks at nickdenardis.com
- One post every Week (or so) at .eduGuru
- One post every Two weeks at the Web Communications blog
- Continue to do the [\[Friday Links\]](http://wcs.wayne.edu/blog/category/links/) on the Web Communications blog
- At least Three EDU Checkup episodes per week.
- Continuous use of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nickdenardis)

In addition to this I would like to start sharing a photo from the week with a few of my close followers ([@nickdenardis](http://twitter.com/nickdenardis) me if you want in). I would also like to determine a clear direction on a book and actually start hashing it out.

Being in the [marketing office](http://mac.wayne.edu/) at [Wayne State University](http://wayne.edu/) I work with a lot of talented people, one being the Editorial Director who just launched a [word driven web site](http://wordwarriors.wayne.edu/). He has inspired me to write better, clearer and more concise. My goal is not only to write on more sites but be more concise in less words.

Words are beautiful, they take expression and inject it right into the mind of the reader. I wanted to publish my goals for 2009 not only to keep track of them but to inspire everyone else if they were thinking of writing more to get to it and make some goals and strive to keep them.

Did you meet your 2008 writing goals? Do you have any 2009 goals?
