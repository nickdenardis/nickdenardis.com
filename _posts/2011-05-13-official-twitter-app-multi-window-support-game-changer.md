Something that has been severely lacking in the [official Twitter desktop app](https://twitter.com/#!/download) has been "multi-window" or multiple view ability. I recently moved from the official app (which I loved because it utilizes stream) to [Twitteriffic](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific) because it was much easier to follow lists and saved searches.

## Open in New Window

The newest update to the Twitter desktop app has completely changed that. Although it is not perfect, you can now take any view and "Open in New Window". This pops it out of the app into its own fully resizable and movable box. It's not yet to the point of [Nambu's](http://nambu.com/) multi view updating and unread counts but it is a step in the right direction.

I am now totally back on board with the official Twitter app again. Thanks for paying attention guys! :-)
