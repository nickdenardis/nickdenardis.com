For our midterm in [GET/POST/HEAD requests. Well it all went well and my group got a 100. The proxy actually preforms very well and handles most pages out there, and has a pretty sophisticated caching engine. Although there is a few drawbacks when the page uses some odd connection types to get its information and multi part POST’s don’t seem to be working but all in all we are very proud how it came out. I will probably be posting the code somewhere to get it out in the public and maybe a viable small scale proxy. We will have to wait till the end of the semester and get approval from my partner.](http://www.cs.wayne.edu/<span>7Eweisong/courses/csc5250-f06/”>CSC5250</a> we were given the task to create an http proxy that handles <span class=)
