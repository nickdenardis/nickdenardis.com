TLDR; Download the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-visual-alt-text/bkpbmomfemcjdeekdffmbohifpndodmi) or [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/social-visual-alt-text/) to visually show alt text on social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and now LinkedIn)

## LinkedIn support

With the update to version 0.7.0 the social visual alt text browser extension now supports LinkedIn single and multiple images. Initial support for images with detection if the image text is machine-generated (when detectable). 

The following situations are now available:

## Single images

| With alt | Without alt |

## Machine-generated alt

## Multiple images

## Existing users

If you already have the extension installed, you will be prompted after it updates to accept the new permissions for LinkedIn. This isn't ideal, but while rolling out the extension I wanted to make sure I only asked for the permissions needed and not overly as for detecting and editing sites that were not yet supported.

## Feedback and feature requests

I've been building this extension in the public on [GitHub](https://github.com/nickdenardis/social-visual-alt-text) and [posting updates on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickdenardis). I'm looking for feedback and on what's working, what isn't working and what would be helpful for you, regardless of how far-fetched it seems. Tag me on Twitter, my DM's are also open or [put in a feature or bug request on Github](https://github.com/nickdenardis/social-visual-alt-text/issues).

I'm hoping to continue building out functionality and refine the code to ensure it is as performant as possible and keeps up with the various user interface changes constantly rolling out to the social media sites.
