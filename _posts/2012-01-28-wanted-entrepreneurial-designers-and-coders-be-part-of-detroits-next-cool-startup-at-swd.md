We love to highlight the many cool startups springing to life in Detroit every year at [TEDxDetroit](http://tedxdetroit.com/). Here's your chance to be part of one.

Startup Weekend is returning to Detroit February 17th. It's a 54-hour celebration of the entrepreneurial spirit. 100 makers, thinkers and doers walk into a building Friday night and 10 new web-based companies emerge on Sunday. From forming teams to brainstorming to business plans to designing mockups to coding prototypes to making the big pitch to venture capitalists, it all happens in one crazy weekend. It's an amazing experience.

If you're an artist, technologist, designer, geek, illustrator, coder or entrepreneur, you need to be part of Startup Weekend Detroit.

This year's event will be even more special as it's being held at the spectacular Madison Building (the home of Detroit Venture Parters, Detroit Labs and several other budding tech companies). It's hosted by a couple of Xs – [Brandon Chestnutt](https://twitter.com/#!/bchesnutt) and [Henry Balanon](https://twitter.com/#!/balanon) (who presented at TEDxDetroit in 2010). Networking, innovation, inspiration and education will surround you. It's the perfect environment in which to test crazy ideas and take the first step towards launching a company that becomes the next big thing.

You can learn more and register at: [http://detroit.startupweekend.org](http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdetroit%2Estartupweekend%2Eorg&urlhash=9Nca&_t=tracking_anet) but don't delay, this event sells out every year.

Come fan that entrepreneurial flame that burns bright inside you. Who knows – we might be hearing all about your success story on stage at the next TEDxDetroit.

Keep Creating -
