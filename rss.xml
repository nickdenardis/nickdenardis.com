            <description><![CDATA[So i broke down today and i bought a new computer. Well it is going to replace my current first generation Mac Mini G4 1.42 Ghz. Basically i found myself pretty much waiting 60% of the time instead of programming. Just having Eclipse, Photoshop, Apache, Firefox and iTunes open grinds this little machine to a halt. My solution yesterday was to just remote into my work machine and do all my work on that, it worked well but it is not a permanent solution. With my mom getting a new 20” iMac and the new Intel chips smoking the pants off the PowerPC chips i needed to upgrade. Also this will allow me to get rid of my Windows box for good, i will be running Parallels for any future Windows needs. The setup i ordered is not like super awesome impressive but it will do for now.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[PHPSimpl is a a PHP framework for rapidly creating classes that mirror MySQL tables. The framework comes with the basic functions to list, display and edit records from the database. With this framework a simple manager and front of a site can be created within a few minutes. An example database, manager and front end are included with the framework.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[So PHP Simpl does a good job of outputting an XHTML form with very extend able features such as labels, required \*’s, size and maxlength calculation, example and error output automatically. But have you ever just wanted to output the form in your own way? Well now you can, this can be accomplished with the FormField() function inside the DbTemplate class. It handles all that same great XHTML formatting, you just have to worry about where you want to flied to be displayed.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This also brings up the situation where possibly all the queries on the page are found in cache and we got to thinking why even bother connecting to the database unless we really need to. So Simpl now will not connect to the database until the first query comes by that could not be found in cache. We have found that this also improves performance especially if the database is on a separate machine. There is only one downside to this addition, when calling $db->Connect() it will always return true since it just stores the database information and waits for the first query, you will no longer be able to check on connect if the database is available or not, it will always look available.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The first beta PHPSimpl has been released to the public. You may be wondering why we decided to start at 0.8, well we have put together a Version History in the wiki and also a short Road Map. We have been using some form of a DbTemplate at WSU for a while now it just has not been public. Over the past two years it has continued to grow and strengthen. After submitting it to google code initially we knew it still needed some work and we took on the challenge of creating a solid framework that could be easily implemented and rapidly create applications with minimal configuration.]]></description>
