[![](/images/picture-1.jpg "Wordpress Notifier")](http://nickdenardis.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/picture-1.jpg)An amazing tool came to my attention today, the [Wordpress Notifier](http://www.wpnotifier.com/). Similar to the [Google Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html) it sits in your OS X status bar and alerts you when you get new comments to your blog. This is great because it allows you to react and respond quicker without having to keep your wp-admin page up all day or constantly get emails when you have other work to do. It even uses [growl](http://growl.info/) for the notifications.

It works with [Wordpress 2.7+](http://wordpress.org/) or [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) but does not yet support [Wordpress MU](http://mu.wordpress.org/). I encourage everyone who has a wordpress blog and uses a mac to take this for a spin.
