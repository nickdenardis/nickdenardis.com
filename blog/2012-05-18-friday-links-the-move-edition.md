title: "[Friday Links] The Move Edition"

I've decided to move my [Friday Links](http://blogs.wayne.edu/web/category/links/) off the [Wayne State Web Communications blog](http://blogs.wayne.edu/web/) and on to my own. It's nothing personal, I've just found that the post doesn't have anything to do with Wayne State. In addition, recent blog posts are listed in [Today@Wayne](http://wayne.edu/today/), a daily html email that goes out to all employees. I found myself on that list far too often. I'll still be posting there, just more Wayne State focused articles. And of course all my posts will also feed in to [EDUniverse](http://eduniverse.org/), and you can [follow me there](http://eduniverse.org/users/nickdenardis).
