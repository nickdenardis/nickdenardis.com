The maintenance people at [@waynestate](http://twitter.com/waynestate) don't have to wrap the cord on the vacuum so neatly after every use but they do it anyways. Not only does this show the skill and care they put into their work but also reflects an attitude that spreads. You cannot dictate this type of care, passionate employees breed a passionate environment.

How much care do you put into your work? You might not realize who is noticing.
