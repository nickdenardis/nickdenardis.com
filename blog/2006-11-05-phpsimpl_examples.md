[PHP Simpl](http://code.google.com/p/phpsimpl/) is a framework that is constantly evolving, and to help anyone who is interested in using the framework we are putting examples in the SVN repo. As of [rev 125](http://phpsimpl.googlecode.com/svn/) we will continuously be adding to the examples folder which will outline the functionality of Simpl and get you up an running in no time. Currently there is just a show blog type application in there but we will be expanding it. Also if you have a good idea for an example or would like to submit your own just post in our [group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/phpsimpl) and we will be sure to help you.
