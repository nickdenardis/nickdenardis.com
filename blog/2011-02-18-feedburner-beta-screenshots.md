[![](/images/feedburner-beta-link.png "feedburner-beta-link")](http://nickdenardis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/feedburner-beta-link.png)If you log in to your [Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com/) account and notice the [Try out the NEW (beta) version!](http://feedburner.google.com/gfb/) I suggest you do. Below is a few screenshots I took of the new interface and tools. It is their first change to the interface after buying the service and to be honest it is a step in the right direction but Google could have done soo much more. The graphs and UI elements are very similar to Google Analytics but not exactly the same. My wish was for GA and Feedburner to be integrated but it looks like we will all have wait a bit longer for the possibility.

In the mean time enjoy these screen shots and try it out for yourself.
