I listen to a lot of podcasts and [Foundation](http://tinyletter.com/foundation) is by far one of my favorite, it is produced by [Kevin Rose](http://kevinrose.com/). In the recent episode Kevin interviewed [Jesse Jacobs, founder of Samovar Tea Lounge](http://samovarlife.com/tag/jesse-jacobs/). The episode centered around his journey opening a brink and mortar store but one section, about nine minutes in, really got me thinking. I encourage you to watch it if you haven't.

> "We have time, we just waste it.
> 
> Say there is two tea cups, one empty and the other half full.
> 
> The half full cup can only be filled half more. The empty tea cup is full of limitless potential. You can put anything in it.
> 
> Instead of living life always half full, always static, buzzing, full of todo lists, emails and everything else. How then instead can we live life to get as empty as possible to allow for that limitless potential."
