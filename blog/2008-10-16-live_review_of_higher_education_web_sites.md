In the last few posts I talked about my passion to critique higher education web sites via [EduStyle.net](http://edustyle.net/). I decided to take it one step further and actually show you what I look for when reviewing these sites.

Again this is the first time I am doing this whole video thing, you actually get to see my mug. Kinda weird right? I was uncomfortable with it at first too.

Anyways here it goes, 15 minutes of fame, I might even do this again. Also I suggest you play the video in full screen to see the sites in greater detail.
