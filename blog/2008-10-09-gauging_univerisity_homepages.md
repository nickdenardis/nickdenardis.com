When you have something soo visible that a committee has to be in control of its every pixel those pixels better be gold. In my 9-5 I see thousands of higher ed web sites and can cut right through the BS and know which ones are designed by _real_ web workers and which ones are slapped together pieces of bureaucracy.

My daily goal which is part of a larger goal is to vote on every site on [edustyle.net](http://edustyle.net/) Right now I am [#5 top user](http://www.edustyle.net/users.php). Soon even closer to #1. I just got through all the A’s, tomorrow all the B’s. Watch out, here I come.

Overall this is part of a large idea I have, I cannot announce it now but I can soon. Stay tuned to see what I have up my sleeve.

Good Night.
