The first beta PHPSimpl has been released to the public. You may be wondering why we decided to start at 0.8, well we have put together a [Version History](http://code.google.com/p/phpsimpl/wiki/VersionHistory) in the wiki and also a short [Road Map](http://code.google.com/p/phpsimpl/wiki/Roadmap). We have been using some form of a DbTemplate at WSU for a while now it just has not been public. Over the past two years it has continued to grow and strengthen. After submitting it to google code initially we knew it still needed some work and we took on the challenge of creating a solid framework that could be easily implemented and rapidly create applications with minimal configuration.
