[Climb 70 flights of stairs](http://nickdenardis.com/2012/01/09/help-me-climb-70-stories-in-the-fight-for-air/ "Help me climb 70 stories in the Fight for Air!") to support the fight against lung cancer. It was probably one of the funnest things I've done. [I finished in 13 minutes, 40 seconds](http://results.active.com/events/climb-detroit--6/70-floor/nick-denardis).

## Doing it again this year

Because it was such a great experience I've decided to do it again this year!

On March 3rd I am going to take on Michigan's tallest building (the [Renaissance Center](https://www.google.com/search?q=Renaissance+Center)) all the way to the 70th floor by climbing 1,035 stairs. I am climbing in the American Lung Association's Fight for Air Climb to help raise money for lung disease research, education and advocacy.

I am doing so because I am able. I can breathe freely and there are many people who are not as lucky. I am joining a team of likeminded Web designers and developers from Detroit on my journey, our team name is the "[Quadzillas](http://action.lung.org/site/TR/Climb/ALAMS_MidlandStates?pg=team&fr_id=5750&team_id=52646)".

### I would love your support

For the 2013 Fight for Air stair climb my team would like to raise a minimum of $1,035 dollars, or $1 for every step in the GM Renaissance Center.
