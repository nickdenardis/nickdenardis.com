[![](/images/box_.jpg "Samsung M610")](http://cgi.ebay.com/Samsung-SPH-M610-Sprint-w-2Gig-Memory-Ton-of-Extras_W0QQitemZ190132063913QQihZ009QQcategoryZ64355QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem)Time has been flying. We have under a year now till the wedding and I have really been trying to get alot of things out of the way and on the right track.

First is getting [rid of a ton of junk](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/tags/trash/) that has been collecting over the years. I threw away all my old computer stuff, just left a few parts which were actually worth some money. And am down to two computers and a laptop.

I have been [putting things up](http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZsega-dreamcasterQQhtZ-1) on eBay randomly. Right now I have two old phones and a bluetooth adapter. My mindset is if i have not used something in three months to get rid of it. I have really been trying to minimize the clutter in my life.

I have been using [Ruby on Rails](http://nickdenardis.blogspot.com/search/label/rails) more and more and it has grown on me, it is simple, straight to the point and a real enjoyable experience.

I have also started jogging every day. I got to a point where my appearance really started to bother me and I needed to do something about it. I really have been enjoying jogging and it actually has given me alot more energy.

I recommend for anyone else who really needs a push into productivity to read both [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/) and [Bit Literacy](http://bitliteracy.com/).
