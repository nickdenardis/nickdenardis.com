There are quite a few WSU's out there, [Wayne State University](http://wayne.edu/) (where I am from), [Washington State University](http://wsu.edu/), [Wichita State University](http://www.wichita.edu/), [Wright State University](http://www.wright.edu/), etc. So referencing WSU on the web doesn't always work.

Today I received a [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) invitation from someone I did not know in person. So I checked out her profile and got down to a reference to Wayne State University. I simply scrolled my mouse over the title and this pop-up appeared:

[![WSU Fail](/images/wsu-fail.png "WSU Fail")](http://nickdenardis.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wsu-fail.png)

The pop-up is a normal action of LinkedIn but the content is completely wrong. They mixed up Washington State and Wayne State!

I cannot tell which university is correct, my guess is Wayne State since their other positions have been in Michigan. Being a programmer at heart I try to analyze how this could possibly happen in my head but the only reason I continue to come up with is lazy programming.

I wonder how many other LinkedIn blunders are out there.
