PHPSimpl 0.8.0 is feature complete and is posted on Google Code. The release candidate will be up for about a week and we will not be adding any more features or API changes. We are only concerted with bug fixed and security issues. Please download it if you are interested in giving it a try and let us know what you think. The final will be out in about a week and we are hoping to have a more feature complete example in it.
