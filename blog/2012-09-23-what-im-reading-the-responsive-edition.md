title: "[What I'm Reading] The responsive edition"

It's been more time than usual since I've posted a "Friday Links" so this weekend when I found myself at RSS zero I thought it would be a good opportunity to rebrand and post "what I'm reading." The idea behind Friday Links was far more than just a list of links that were published during the week, these links were able to catch my full attention, which is hard to do with the schedule I have.

The last few weeks have exploded the responsive concept in to a full blown science, even Google Analytics is getting involved with reporting on hard numbers. The links below represent what I've been paying attention to and what I feel you should at least take a glance at. Enjoy.
