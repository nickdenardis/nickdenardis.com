Do you use a cool tool or app that helps you with your workflow you’d like to share with others? Join us at Washtenaw Community College in the Morris Lawrence Building building in Ann Arbor at 6:00pm for our Share Your Favorite Tool Night meet-up, where you can share with others a great app or tool that makes your work easier.

This is a great opportunity to:

- share cool apps and tools
- find out what others have been working on
- learn about new tools that can improve your work

Each person has five to ten minutes to demo and answer questions. This is a great way to get to know other Refresh Detroit members. If you’re planning on presenting, [send us a message](http://refreshdetroit.org/contact/ "Contact Us") to let us know or better yet just post it in the comments section below.

**Don’t want to share this time? No problem! Please still come.**

**Where:** Morris Lawrence Building at Washtenaw Community College, Room 121. ([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=4800+E.+Huron+River+Dr.,+Ann+Arbor,+MI,+United+States,+48105&hl=en&hnear=4800+E+Huron+River+Dr,+Ann+Arbor+Charter+Township,+Michigan+48105&gl=us&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A))
