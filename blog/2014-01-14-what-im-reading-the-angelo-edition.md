Last week my wife and I welcomed a new addition into our family, [Angelo DeNardis](http://angelodenardis.com/). It has been exciting and awesome at the same time. It has also allowed me to catch up on some much needed reading, writing and thinking. The links below caught my attention this last week and I hope you find something interesting.
