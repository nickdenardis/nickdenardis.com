It took just a few hours and my misspelled title on a [Flickr photo](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/2409047888/) made it to the top spot on Google and Yahoo. With thousands of photos being uploaded every minute it amazes me how efficient search engines are.

Often I use google to search for the correct spelling of words. Mainly because I have way too many thoughts running around, if I stop to really think about a words spelling I could loose more important ideas. Words don’t change their spelling too often.

**“creepyist”** was one of those words. Im so use to OS X’s inline spell checker that sending photos from my phone often results in misspelled words. In the 3 hours the misspelled word was on Flickr before I had a chance to correct it, it made it to the top of the search results of Google and Yahoo. Unfortunately MSN lagged behind and missed my misspelling.

**Reindexing**  
Now reindexing, that is a different issue. It has been a few hours since I made the change and still no update from Google or Yahoo. Seems odd, but I guess the more accurate the first time you upload the better its position.
