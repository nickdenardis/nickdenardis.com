## Going it alone is a recipe for failure

A university is filled with people doing incredible things. I’ve work in and around higher education professionals for 15 years. I’m constantly amazed by their ingenuity and willingness to share their lessons learned.

### Ideas are just ideas without the support of others

Taking the time to shop an idea around before it is presented is required for success. Getting not only feedback from the primary audience but also anyone who will be living with its implementation.

At a college or university, enrollment initiatives can take years before results start rolling in. Because of this campuses are notoriously skeptical of ideas without legs.

Relying on outside experts can give ideas a boost. Organizations like [Helix Education](https://www.helixeducation.com/?utm_campaign=EGH-ND) are in a unique spot, they interact with numerous institutions with similar goals and have been able to test and prove strategies.

### Playing the game

Helix Education knows the key to success is partnerships. They know higher education so well, they created a game that speaks volumes.

They took their playbook and the struggles they’ve seen across institutions and brought it to life in a digital world you can play.

The game is really well done and even includes a secret if you’re enough of an explorer.

This is a must play for any higher education professional or anyone working at an institution that requires partnerships for an idea to be successful.
