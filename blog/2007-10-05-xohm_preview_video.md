I just got a newsletter about Sprint Xohm and they didnâ€™t say much about anything but did include a nifty video. I thought the video was pretty compelling and was not like any of their other videos i have seen before.

I think Xohm will revolutionize how we are connected to the world, it will give devices that normally would need to be connected with wires the ability to actually be useful.

Anyways on to the video.
