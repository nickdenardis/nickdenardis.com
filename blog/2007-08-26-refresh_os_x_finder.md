[![Refresh Finder Button](/images/finder-refresh.png)](http://www.soderhavet.com/refresh/)The Apple products and community never cease to amaze me. When there is a problem to solve more than likely someone has already created an elegant solution. An experience I had today reinforced my findings ten fold.

I have a few shares on a network drive that I connect from OS X via Samba. Files get populated into those folders by other applications and when they are ready I goto the directory and pick them up. Well Finder has a mysterious refresh rate for directories… I have never been able to figure it out and there is to my knowledge no hotkey to manually refresh.

So I goto good ol’ Google to [find a solution](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=v7K&q=OS+X+refresh+finder+listing&btnG=Search)… Looks like nothing built in, but there is this nifty utility called [Refresh Finder](http://www.soderhavet.com/refresh/). Built on AppleScript it is lightweight and does what it needs and gets out of the way.

I hate to say it but it far surpasses any elegant solutions I have seen for Windows. Usually those include some constantly running application in the background, starting at startup, always looking for an update, and probably costing $19.99 nagware.

Downloaded and installed in 2 minutes. This will save a lot of time, usually I end up having to just randomly click on folders to hit something that is not cached so Finder can do a refresh. Now there is a refresh button similar to on Safari in the Finder toolbar and life is quite a bit less stressful.

A definite download for any Mac user. If I were to rate it a 10 out of 10 would be in order. Great work [S�derhavet](http://www.soderhavet.com/).
