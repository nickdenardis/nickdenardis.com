Recently at both work and home clients have been asking to start their projects immediately. We have a billing system at work keep track of project progress but it doesnâ€™t do a great job of scheduling projects for the future. Which makes it hard to justify how many resources are tied up at any given moment in the future.

I have always been a proponent of the [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) (Getting Things Done) method so I started trying out software. What I found was most suck at getting things done, I was left with a clunky and confusing taste in my mouth.

Then I tried [Things](http://www.culturedcode.com/things/) and it changed my life. It allowed me to create all my projects, teammates and tasks with just a few clicks. Organize them into areas and begin work. It could not have been simpler or look more elegant.

Below is a screen shot from a few days ago listing the projects and their next steps. Things for today are listed in red and other peoples tasks have their names by it all in one screen, it is like a dream come true.

Translating from Things to our billing system which has a task manger I thought everyone would get freaked out seeing soo many far future tasks but I got quite the opposite reaction. They enjoyed seeing what was coming up and during downtime or when their brain was fried they could go on to a future task and get it out of the way.

Efficiency has gone up about 200% due to Things. If you are in a situation with multiple projects with multiple deadlines or clients this can be a life savor.
