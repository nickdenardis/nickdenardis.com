[![Friday Night](/images/1153499355_e9c175eb65_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/1153499355/ "Photo Sharing")My new setup is quite comfortable. Hosting by [Joyent](http://joyent.com) running on a Shared Accelerator using [Mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/) proxyied through [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) to run a [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) application known as [SimpleLog](http://simplelog.net) with a green inspired simple style theme created by [Myself](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle) using a new CSS framework called [Blueprint](http://blueprintcss.googlecode.com).

From the time my DNS change went through it took only about an hour to get the whole thing up and running. Although while typing this I am still waiting for a Mongrel port, running Mongrel by hand works just fine.

The setup was good timing because [Andrea](http://flickr.com/photos/dorkstyle/tags/andrea/) is working late and I am still trying to wrap my head around all the upcoming decisions needed to be made about [wayne.edu](http://wayne.edu/). I am now the Interim Web Manager in the Marketing Department. With the new position comes some new goals and I am currently putting them together and hope to bring my experience with high load shared server environments in some upcoming articles.

Eventually all my old archived articles from my blogger account will get moved over, I just need the motivation to do it.
